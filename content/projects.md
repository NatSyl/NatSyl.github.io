### Akzonobel
Akzonobel is a Dutch multinational company which creates paints and performance coatings for both industry and consumers.  It is the parent company for paint brands including Dulux, Cuprinol and Hammerite.
During my time at Akzonobel I had a number of roles that saw me successfully launch and steer the development of two completely new online products  (Dulux Amazing Space) and drive the brand agenda for the more seasoned brands, namely dulux, dulux Trade and Cuprinol.
